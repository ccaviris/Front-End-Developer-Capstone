    <h1>Welcome to Little Lemon! Try our new online reservations page!</h1>
    <p> We heard your feedback and we listened. Sure, we didn't want to spend a lot of money, so we didn't pay anyone to rebuild our booking page. However, we got a down on his luck developer between jobs to do it for FREE...err, I mean, for "job experience"! (what a sucker). Anyway, we can pass the saving onto you, the valued customer (or at least we can tell you that and double our prices anyway). <br/> <a href="/reservations">Click here to make your reservation today!</a>
